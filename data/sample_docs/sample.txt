Hello, 

On 22 Jan, 2025 we had a flight from Kolkata (CCU) to Stockholm (ARN) (PNR  JV418P), with connections in Mumbai (BOM) and Istanbul (IST). The flight from Mumbai to Istanbul was delayed 8 hours. It was supposed to leave around 06:55 a.m., however it left at 14:30 on 23 Jan, 2025. This delay cost us numerous damages, including financial, academic, and work-related, which are described below.

1. We missed our flight to Stockholm (ARN) on January 23, 2025 from Istanbul.
2. We also missed our pre-booked train from Stockholm to our home on the same day (cost: 1626 SEK squandered).
3. We would have arrived home at 7:00 a.m. on January 24, 2025 (today), but we arrived in Stockholm only a few hours ago.
4. We missed the office, critical meetings, an exam, and a full day of work.
5. We had to arrange another train ticket to our destination, which cost 1805 SEK.
7. We will return home at 23:35 instead of 7:00 a.m.
8. We are travelling for 41 hours or more.

So, we suffered greatly as a result of Indigo's delay, and we are demanding full compensation, including the payment of our train tickets from Stockholm.
